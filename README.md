Installation
-------------

Symlink the script to a location visible by `PATH`. I have mine set to `~/bin`.

An optional global variable `GIT_CACHED_DIR` can be set. This is where the cached objects are stored. The default is shown below.

```bash
export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
export GIT_CACHED_DIR=$HOME/.gitobjectstore
```

Alternative installation: Replacing "git" altogether
----------------------------------------------------

You can also replace the `git` command globally, which is very helpful f.e. when working with (legacy) tools
and scripts which are hard-coded to use the `git` binary. This f.e. applies to [composer](http://getcomposer.org/) (which is a PHP package management solution).

You need to rename `gitc` to `git` and place it on your `$PATH` such that it is loaded *first*, i.e. before
the normal git (f.e. in `~/bin`). Furthermore, you need to set the environment variable `PATH_TO_GITC` such
that it points to the original `git` command.

So, in a nutshell:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/bin/

cp /path/to/gitc ~/bin/git
```

Afterwards, add the following to your `~/.profile` or `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` (depending on what you use):

```bash
##### GITC Git Cache #####
export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
export GITC_ORIGINAL_GIT=/path/to/original/git
alias git-uncached=$GITC_ORIGINAL_GIT
```


Usage
------

`gitc` accepts all `git` commands. For the ones it does not know of, it will simply pass-through to git.

When cloning with `gitc`, it will transparently use the cache.

```bash
gitc clone --branch 8.x git://git.drupal.org/project/drupal.git
```

If at anytime you need to remove all reference to the cache (runs `git repack -a -d -l` and removes pointer in the alternates file.:

```bash
gitc cache-detach
```

It can be added back at any time (runs `git gc` garbage collection to remove local objects):

```bash
gitc cache-attach
```

To repair it (it simply detaches and reattaches):

```bash
gitc cache-repair
```

If you need to run git commands on the cache store itself, use the `cache` sub-command:

```bash
gitc cache remote
```

When cloning, attaching or repairing, you can pass in a `--store-group` option to tell it to use a separate object store. It defaults to `default`.

```bash
gitc clone --store-group foobar --branch 8.x git://git.drupal.org/project/drupal.git
```

The above command will point the object store to `$HOME/.gitobjectstore/foobar`. (defaults to `$HOME/.gitobjectstore/default`)

Notes
------

  - The cached clone is set with `--reference` pointing to the object storage. See the man page for git-clone.
  - If you move the clone to another machine it may invalidate the path pointing to the object store. Changing `GIT_CACHE_DIR` will do the same. Simply call `gitc cache-repair` in your working directory to fix it.
  - This is the first bash script Iâ€™ve created. Consider this a fair warning. Tested on Mac OSX Lion.
  - I personally don't use this for critical work. I'm using this to reduce the bandwidth and disk space on multiple versions of checked out repos that are mostly read only. It does work fine from what I've tested.
  - This new development version is incompatible with the master branch.
